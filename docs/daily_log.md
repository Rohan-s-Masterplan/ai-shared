# AI-Shared Project â€“ Daily Log

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ 9 Aug 2025
**Goal:** Create production-ready scaffold for `ai-shared` repository for multi-project AI infrastructure.

---

### âœ… Work Done
1. Deleted old scaffold to avoid mid-project refactoring.
2. Created **production-grade folder structure** with:
   - Modular Python package (`ai_shared/`)
   - Config folder
   - Utilities
   - Tests
   - Docs
   - Docker
   - GitHub CI/CD
   - Pre-commit setup
3. Added **pinned dependencies** in `requirements.txt` for stability.
4. Created `.env.example` for safe API key/config sharing.
5. Added `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets, venv, cache files.
6. Set up **pre-commit hooks** for linting and formatting.
7. Added **GitHub Actions CI** for auto lint + tests.
8. Installed dependencies and pre-commit locally.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps (Day 2)
- Implement `logging.py` with structured, color-coded logging.
- Implement `embeddings/base.py` with abstract embedding provider.
- Implement `vectorstores/chroma.py` for vector DB adapter.
